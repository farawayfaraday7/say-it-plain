# Statement

**Say It Plain** is an art project about war as a public language: images, slogans, evidence, denial, and silence.

This site is two things at once:

- **A gallery**: curated works grouped by topic.
- **A forum**: a place to post, respond, and argue in good faith.

## What I’m trying to do
War is often presented as distant, inevitable, or clean—until it isn’t.  
This project rejects euphemism. It asks for clarity: what is being done, to whom, by whom, and for what.

The goal is not comfort. The goal is attention.

## What this is not
This project is **not** propaganda for any side.  
It is not a call to violence.  
It is not an attempt to “balance” suffering as if it were a debate scorecard.

It is an invitation to look, think, and disagree openly.

## How to engage
If you share work or comment here, bring a claim:

- **What are you saying?**
- **What are you challenging?**
- **What evidence, experience, or reasoning are you relying on?**

Disagreement is welcome. Dehumanization is not.

## Content warning
This project contains themes of war, violence, displacement, and trauma.  
Some images may be disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.

## Moderation
This space is moderated. Content may be removed to protect participants and keep the forum usable.

- No harassment or targeting individuals/groups.
- No threats, doxxing, or calls for real-world violence.
- Credit artists. No stolen work.
- Label graphic content.

## Why a forum?
Because war is not only fought with weapons; it is fought with narratives.  
A gallery shows images. A forum exposes the arguments around them.

**Post your work. Make your case.**
