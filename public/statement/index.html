<p><strong>Say It Plain</strong> is an art project about war as a public language: images, slogans, evidence, denial, and silence.</p>
<p>This site is two things at once:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A gallery</strong>: curated works grouped by topic.</li>
<li><strong>A forum</strong>: a place to post, respond, and argue in good faith.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-im-trying-to-do">What I’m trying to do</h2>
<p>War is often presented as distant, inevitable, or clean—until it isn’t.<br>
This project rejects euphemism. It asks for clarity: what is being done, to whom, by whom, and for what.</p>
<p>The goal is not comfort. The goal is attention.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-is-not">What this is not</h2>
<p>This project is <strong>not</strong> propaganda for any side.<br>
It is not a call to violence.<br>
It is not an attempt to “balance” suffering as if it were a debate scorecard.</p>
<p>It is an invitation to look, think, and disagree openly.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-engage">How to engage</h2>
<p>If you share work or comment here, bring a claim:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are you saying?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What are you challenging?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What evidence, experience, or reasoning are you relying on?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Disagreement is welcome. Dehumanization is not.</p>
<h2 id="content-warning">Content warning</h2>
<p>This project contains themes of war, violence, displacement, and trauma.<br>
Some images may be disturbing. Viewer discretion is advised.</p>
<h2 id="moderation">Moderation</h2>
<p>This space is moderated. Content may be removed to protect participants and keep the forum usable.</p>
<ul>
<li>No harassment or targeting individuals/groups.</li>
<li>No threats, doxxing, or calls for real-world violence.</li>
<li>Credit artists. No stolen work.</li>
<li>Label graphic content.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-a-forum">Why a forum?</h2>
<p>Because war is not only fought with weapons; it is fought with narratives.<br>
A gallery shows images. A forum exposes the arguments around them.</p>
<p><strong>Post your work. Make your case.</strong></p>
